# 📝 About Me


I have been with Guangzhou University since September 2023. Before joining GZHU,
I worked as a software engineer at Gauss. I obtained my PhD from Department
of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, Chinese University of Hong
Kong, proudly under the supervision of [Prof. Jeffrey Xu
Yu](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-yu-xu-jeffrey).
My research is focused on graph algorithms and incremental computation.
